**ENHANCING CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS WITH RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) MODEL**  

**INTRODUCTION**  
"Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare could boost India's GDP by USD 25-30 billion by 2025, driven by initiatives like the IndiaAI Mission." quotes The Economic Times according to a report from Deloitte, enhnacing accesibilty, diagnostics and treatment outcomes. The IndiaAI Mission focuses towards setting the stage for a digitally empowered healthcare ecosystem, with resposible AI integration and enhnaced data security.In recent times, there has been a significant surge in research articles and industry analyses on transformative role AI plays in medical decision supoort. With advancements in modern healthcare, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) has emerged in assisting with diagnostics, recommendations in treatment and healthcare management.   

Conventional CDSS is associated with drawbacks in terms of limited knowledge updates and poor contextual understanding. In addition to this, traditional Machine Learning (ML) models and Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but lack real-time adaptability and evidence based decision making capabilities.The future of AI in healthcare lies in ethical human-centred AI models that enhance- but not replace-clinical expertise. A comprehensive solution must be formulated for integration of retrievl-based AI models and real-time patient monitoring.  

To mitigate all the drawbacks of conventional CDSS, the aim of our project revolves around implementing a unique approach to enhance clinical decision support making it more interpretable, data-driven and highly adaptive to faciliate most relevant and evidence-based insights for improving patient outcomes. The ultimate goal is to successfully generate a Retrieval-Augemnetation Model (RAG) model by integrating real-time information retrieval with natural language generation.
